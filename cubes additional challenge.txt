Classification of a Piece:
12221
23332
23332
23332
12221

1:Corner parts: shared between 3 pieces
2:Edge parts: shared between 2 pieces
3:Center parts: not shared, always filled

Possible edge configurations: 
001:a,ln ry 
010:s,ln rn
011:a,ln ry
100:b,ly rn
101:s,ly ry
110:b,ly rn

where 
s specifies a self-symmetric configuration, and a and b are chiral partners.
n/y specifies whether the edges on the left/right can be connected to a corner.

Special rules:
*remove duplicates under rotation and mirroring
*flat border configurations are not allowed. (assumption: 10000, 10001 configuration not allowed for stability reasons)
*corners must be connected to a edge piece

Number of unique edge configurations: (count only one of the chiral partners for opposing edges on the same piece) 
bottom,side and top edges: 6^2*4^2 possibilities each
divide by 24 to account for roll/pitch/yaw rotations (octahedral symmetry)
so 1/24 * 6^6*4^6 edge combinations.

Corner configurations:
each corner is connected to 6 edge configurations located in 3 sides.
one and only one of each pair of connected edge can have a corner connected to it
so for half of the unique edge configurations, a edge is possible on all 3 connected pieces
and for the other half a edge is possible in 2 of the 3 connected pieces

therefore, the total number of unique puzzles is:
5/6 * 1/24 * 6^4*4^6 =  6635520 puzzles.
